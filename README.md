# About me

**Zerrius** (Michael Bacca)

Self taught dev in progress. I build things, break things, rebuild them slightly better. Still broken. The loop continues.

## Current Focus
- Game dev systems and prototypes (Unity / Godot)
- Modding and plugin style projects
- Learning tooling, Git, and better workflows
- Small projects that actually ship (even tiny ones)

## Interests
- Game mechanics and progression systems
- Survival systems (buffs, hunger, thirst, leveling)
- Automation and quality of life tools
- Terminal stuff and clean setups

## Learning Right Now
- C# (Unity)
- Java (plugins/modding)
- A little Python when it helps

## Looking For
- Beginner friendly collaborations (game dev, tools, plugins)
- Help getting better at code structure and architecture
- People who like building and learning in public

## Status
🚧 Under construction. Everything here is a work in progress.
