Builder focused on AI-driven systems, agent orchestration, and game development tooling.

I explore how intelligent agents, structured memory, and workflow automation can transform the way solo developers design and build games. My current work centers around PRISM, a cognitive framework for orchestrating AI agents, managing long-term knowledge, and accelerating creative development.

## What I Work On

- Multi-agent AI architectures and orchestration workflows  
- Knowledge systems combining graph, vector, and temporal memory  
- Developer tools for AI-assisted game creation  
- Experimental pipelines that connect research → prototype → playable systems  

## Current Focus

Designing practical AI systems that move beyond demos and become real creative infrastructure for builders and game developers.

## Philosophy

I believe the future of development is not just writing code, but designing intelligence that collaborates with us.  
My goal is to help shape tools where imagination, systems thinking, and AI meet.

Always learning. Always building. Always curious.
