## About Me

I'm a Maintenance Technician with a strong passion for web development, game design, and automation. I'm currently on a journey to expand my skill set and make the transition into the tech industry.

### Professional Background

With a background in maintenance, I’ve developed a sharp attention to detail and a strong problem-solving mindset. My hands-on experience has taught me the critical importance of precision, whether it's diagnosing a complex issue or ensuring that machinery operates smoothly. Patience has been key in troubleshooting challenging problems, while continuous learning has kept me adaptable in a field where technology and techniques are always evolving. These skills have not only made me effective in my current role but have also laid a solid foundation as I transition into the tech industry.

### Interests

- **Web Development**: I enjoy building responsive and dynamic web applications using technologies like JavaScript frameworks, CSS preprocessors, and modern HTML5 and CSS3 standards.
  
- **Game Design**: Creating immersive experiences and interactive stories is a passion of mine. I’m particularly drawn to 2D platformers and role-playing games where creativity meets technical challenges.
  
- **Automation**: I’m fascinated by the potential of automation to streamline processes and improve efficiency, making complex tasks more manageable and systems more reliable.

### Goals

- **Collaboration**: I am eager to collaborate with other developers on web design projects, particularly those that challenge and expand my current skill set. I value teamwork and believe that knowledge sharing is essential for both personal and professional growth. By working closely with others, I hope to gain new perspectives, learn best practices, and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.
 
- **Learning**: I am actively seeking guidance and resources to improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Strengthening these skills is a key focus for me as I prepare for technical interviews and strive to enhance my problem-solving abilities. I am open to mentorship, peer study groups, and practical projects that will help me master these critical concepts and apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.
  
### Personal life
- Balancing my full-time job as a maintenance technician with being a husband and father to five daughters is no small feat, but it’s a challenge I embrace daily. On top of that, I’m self-teaching computer science and web development, driven by a love for learning and a desire to build a better future for my family.
